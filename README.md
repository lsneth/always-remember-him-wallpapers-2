# Always Remember Him Wallpapers

This is a mobile app created in React Native that provides wallpapers of Jesus Christ. It's purpose is to help people remember Christ in their every day lives. I am creating this project to get a basic understanding of React Native and practice JavaScript and JSX.

# Development Environment

I am using React Native to build this app using Javascript and JSX.

# Useful Websites

* [React Navigation](https://reactnavigation.org/)
* [React Native Documentation](https://reactnative.dev/docs/getting-started)

# Future Work

* Link the app with the native system settings so that the wallpaper can actually be set
* Put in better wallpapers (the ones there now look kinda sketch)
* Have a 'daily wallpaper' option that automatically sets a new wallpaper every day
* Get the images dynamically from a folder, then later get them dynamically from a database. (Currently they are hardcoded.)
* Create a standard wallpaper setter UI. (drag/resize, set home screen or lock screen or both)
* Upload it to the Google Play and App store
